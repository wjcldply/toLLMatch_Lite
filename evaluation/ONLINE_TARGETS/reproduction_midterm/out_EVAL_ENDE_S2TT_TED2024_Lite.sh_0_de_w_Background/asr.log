I would like to invite you on a little thought experiment.
Let's pretend that we're going on a polar expedition together, all of you and me, and we need to hire a captain.
One comes from a man who has already successfully achieved all four of the major polar goals, the North Pole and the South Pole, and the Northeast and the Northwest Passage.
In fact, three of these he was the first person to accomplish.
Candidate B is a man who set off for the Antarctic four times, three times as the man in charge, and every time resulted in failure, catastrophe, or death.
But, But in reality, we often trick ourselves into hiring candidate B or someone like him.
Meanwhile, candidate A, the Norwegian rolled Amundsen by any metric, the most successful polar explorer to have ever lived, has been largely forgotten.
I did a quick search in my university's library catalog before this talk, and I found no fewer than 26 books that celebrate Shackleton's leadership qualities.
For Amundsen, I found four, two of which I wrote.
Why are we obsessed with a mediocre at best, leader and overlooking a truly gifted one?.
Well, I'm a historian who's studies leadership and I'm here to tell you we celebrate the wrong leaders, and not just in the realm of polar exploration.
You probably discuss him around the coffee machines in the mornings.
He was born an illiterate slave and rose to become one of the most influential revolutionaries ever and outsmarted the biggest empires of the day, including Napoleon's.
And this is not just an academic or a trivial insight.
All the challenges that we face today require people to work together, and this in turn requires somebody who can motivate them, inspire them, coordinate the work, deal with whatever hiccup might arise along the way.
But for this reason, it's important that we celebrate the right leaders because the leaders we celebrate are the leaders we learn from.
And so in this sense, the leaders we celebrate has a direct impact on the success or as it may be, failure of our greatest endeavors today.
But there's another culprit at work as well, what I like to call the action fallacy.
Our mistaken belief that the best leaders are those who generate the most noise, action, and sensational activity in the most dramatic circumstances.
In other words, we confuse a good story for good leadership.
As a matter of fact very often good leadership will result in a bad story.
Imagine leadership for one moment, not as a polar explorer, charting a new course or a CEO motivating her staff, but as the simple act of swimming across a river.
Imagine a violent river with waves crashing together and rocks lurking somewhere below the surface.
If if a swimmer ventures in haphazardly without being aware of his own capabilities or the currents and nearly drowns, but splashes around wildly, fights with all his strength, and somehow miraculously manages to drag himself back to safety, those of us looking on will notice him.
He really fought hard to get himself out of that crisis.
Thank And if instead we have a swimmer who has studied the river for years and knows just where and when to enter the water and how to turn her body in subtle ways and so lets the current carry her across, we probably won't notice her.
And if we do, we would probably say, eh, that looks pretty easy.
And he and his men were then forced to undertake a dangerous trek across the ice and brave some of the stormiest seas on earth before finally reaching the safety of South Georgia in the summer of 1916.
In fact, it was made into TV series starring a young Kenneth Branagh.
But it is not a story fit to draw leadership lessons from.
He overlooked the advice from local whalers who told him the ice was particularly dangerous that season.
Any And he overlooked massive deficits in his equipment preparation, crew selection, and training.
Rarely highlighted in the many books that celebrate his leadership qualities is the fact that the expedition's other ship, the Aurora, suffered an even graver crisis, the result of which was three lost lives.
In contrast, the expeditions of the Royal Amundsen make for boring reading.
Not because he was lucky, but because based on his intimate knowledge of the polar environment, his careful and deliberate planning, and his authentic and innovative leadership in the field, he managed to reduce the problems that his team encountered to a bare minimum.
In 1905, he achieved in a tiny fishing vessel what the mighty British Navy had failed to do the previous eight decades, to find and navigate the Northwest Passage above the Canadian mainland.
If Shackleton is the swimmer who rushes recklessly into the water without understanding the currents or his own capabilities, amundsen is the swimmer who has spent a lifetime humbly studying the river before entering the water in just the right spot at just the right time, and so makes it look easy.
Thank Now, Now action fallacy causes real problems, and not just for our interpretation of the past.
I arrived at it through my work as a historian interested in why we celebrate some leaders of the past but not others.
But it's a dangerous feature in our offices today as well because after all, the same biases and misconceptions that we bring to our reading of the past are one and the same with which we view leadership in our offices today.
It is the Shackletons of our offices, rather than the Amundsons who serve as role models who get promoted, and who get rewarded.
In fact, this is something studies in organizational psychology have confirmed.
We see leadership potential in people who speak more, regardless of what they say.
In people who appear confident regardless of how competent they are.
And we have an unyielding admiration for people who are perpetually busy, regardless of what their actually doing.
I see some of you are imagining specific people in your office right now.
In other words, a to be a good leader rather than actually being one behind the scenes is the path to fame and bonus and promotion today.
With the wrong leaders in charge, organizations are obviously not performing at their full potential.
And he creates a toxic culture in which those actually doing good work feel overlooked and demotivated.
So this is a problem that we need to solve.
And it's starts with reimagining what good leadership looks like.
First, we have to learn to ignore what we can call the captains of crisis the Shackleton those who are lurching from one dramatic circumstance to another.
Keith Grint, the preeminent scholar of leadership today, brilliantly summarizes this problematic dynamic.
Since we reward people who are good in crises and ignore people who are such good managers that there are few crises, people soon learn to seek out or reframe situations as crises.
We need to disincentivize the style of leadership by refusing to give these people the attention they crave.
And that's easy when we're confronted with the sober facts.
But as soon as it's embedded in a story, the dramatic details pull us in like a magnet and give us a false sense of inspiration.
Instead, we need to learn to celebrate those who mitigate rather than promote drama.
And this can be challenging because often they do so in very subtle ways below the surface of the water in the case of our swimmer.
They build processes that allow them to build their the unique challenges they face.
And they're authentic and create cultures that bring out the best in people.
I don't want to give you too many technical academic terms here, but this is an important one.
I'm going to do But as she tells us from her research, the evidence is clear that boring management matters.
It may not be as exciting as leading a cavalry charge from the front or giving a brash pep talk, but it's the real toolkit of good leaders.
The action fallacy tricks us into celebrating the wrong leaders and this comes with huge costs.
And this starts with reimagining what good leadership looks like.
So the next time you're in a position to judge or reward a leader or maybe just the next time you're trying to figure out who's efforts actually guide your team or organization to success, resist the temptation to be dazzled by tales of adventure and daring do, and take a moment to look below the surface or in the quieter corners of your team.
And this is important because the next time your organization is faced with the equivalent of the ice pack looming on the horizon, who do you want in charge?.
The leader who respects to this ship freezing in place by frantically cranking the engine unpacking the crates of dynamite, and pushing his men to their breaking point,.
Thank Over Or the leader who avoids getting stuck in the ice in the first place.
