I would like to invite you on a little thought experiment.
Let's pretend that we're going on a polar expedition together, all of you and me, and we need to hire a captain.
One comes from a man who has already successfully achieved all four of the major polar goals, the North Pole and the South Pole and the Northeast and the Northwest Passage.
In fact, three of these, he was the first person to accomplish.
Candidate B is a man who set off for the Antarctic four times, three times is the man in charge, and every time resulted in failure, catastrophe, or death.
But, in reality, we often trick ourselves into hiring candidate B or someone like him.
Meanwhile, candidate A, the Norwegian rolled Amundsen, by any metric, the most successful poll explorer to have ever lived, has been largely forgotten.
I did a quick search in my university's library catalog before this talk, and I found no fewer than 26 books that celebrate Shackleton's leadership qualities.
For Amundsen, I found four, two of which I wrote.
Why are we obsessed with a mediocre, at leader, and overlooking a truly gifted one?.
